Glo Checklists
==============
Add checklists to any model via a template.

Configure checklists in the Settings > Technical > Checklist Templates menu.
Each checklist template can be associated with a model and any number of
form views, or all forms for that model, or "None" and you modify the views
yourself!

Domains can be used to apply checklists to specific records, and to block
records from reaching certain states until all required checklist items are
completed.

Want to confirm all preliminary steps are completed before confirming a
Sales Order? No problem!

Want to make sure a checklist is completed before closing a Helpdesk Ticket?
Easy!

Want to make sure a checklist is completed before a customer can be assigned
to a salesperson? Done!

All checklists log the user who completed each item, and the time it was
completed including if it was completed, uncompleted and then completed again.
Admins can view the history of each checklist item.
