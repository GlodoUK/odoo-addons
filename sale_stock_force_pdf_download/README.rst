Sale Stock Force PDF Download
=============================

Force PDF download instead of PDF preview when viewing stock picking records via the sales order portal

This fixes a bug related to certain PDF extensions that run in Chrome whereby the request to "Print" via the portal causes the PDF preview to request the same file repeatedly in a loop, which eventually consumes all available workers.
